This started like a classwork and I continued working in to make a calculator in php code. To the goal of learn more in this language and train my skill in programming thats the final code.

To run this php you first need to have some server on your own or one server emulator. After that run first the calc.php or you have going to see some mensage's errors. Next you will see a really intuitive menu that can make you feel like you are using a calculate. You can introduce your numbers with your keyboard or can use the arrows to change the values. Remember, you need to asign some action or calc will show you an error. When you have write your operations you can click (Or press Enter/intro button in your keyboard) to see your solve.

And thats all. You can go back to the calc.php using the url.

Feel free to use this calculator or his code to your own purpose.
